<h1>Amun Govil Lie</h1>

<h2>A Short Biography</h2>
<p> Hello. My name is Amun Govil Lie. I was born in Oslo to a Norwegian father and Indian mother. 
    In my youth, I enjoyed playing sports (football, basketball and tennis) and learning new things.
    I did not like waking up early, frequently missing early morning classes, but I did well in my exams. 
    I graduated middle school with a GPA of 5.47/6 and high school with a GPA of 5.73/6 (before added points). <br>
    <br>    
    I was then in the fortunate position of having many options available for my further studies. Within Norway, my GPA was high enough for automatic admission to any university program. I was particularly tempted by the Industrial Economics and Technology Management programme at NTNU. But I had ambitions to go abroad. These ambitions did not translate into very good planning. I managed to take the SAT test (involving a last-minute night bus to Gothenburg) and ahieved a good score of 1450/1600, but did not manage to take subject tests which at the time were strongly recommended for top US university admissions. <br>
<br>
My focus shifted to the UK. I sent applications to programmes in Physics & Philosophy at Oxford and King's College London. Again, planning was not my strong suit. I failed to realize the Oxford programme required a Physics Aptitute Test (PAT) until two weeks before the deadline. I didn't stand a chance. However, King's accepted me. And with that, the decision was taken.<br>
<br>
I arrived in London on a sunny day in September 2018. I stayed at a friend's friend for two weeks before securing the cheapest university accommodation I could find - £600 per month. It was dingy and crowded. A small kitchen was shared by 14 people. I didn't like it but prices everywhere else seemed crazy.<br>
<br>
University life was difficult. My room felt lonely, my commute was stressful, and food options at the university primarily consisted of expensive chains on the Strand. The physics curriculum started off in an unfamiliar place for me and teaching style ssemed more based on repition than understanding. I quickly fell off. In trying to keep up with the physics curriculum, I neglected philosophy readings, resulting in mediocre results in both subjects. I found everyday tasks such as laundry, commuting, grocery shopping and preparing food left little time for studying. <br>
<br>
The semesters would finish before I could blink an eye. Two semesters per academic year with just ten weeks in each. With such short semesters I felt pressure to find summer internships. The advantage of London is that there are many opportunities available. The disadvantage is that you never run out of applications to write. Distracting me from the depressing state of affairs of my studies, I would write endless applications, each of which represented hope for something new.<br>
<br>
And so my bachelor's degree passed. In the middle of it, Covid happened, but for me things went on the same. I did get some internships and I graduated with ok results - Upper Second Class Honours (B). But I was deeply upset about the learning experience. I felt my understanding of physics was barely any better than when I started, and therefore that I could not go on with postgraduate studies. <br>
<br>
This meant venturing into the corporate world. I sent hundreds of applications during my last year. In June of 2021, I finally received two offers - one as an AI/ML Annotation Analyst at Apple in Cork and the second as a Graduate Data Analytics Consultant at Ernst & Young in Edinburgh. I went with Edinburgh.<br>
<br>
It was another sunny September day when I arrived at the Edinurgh Waverly train station for the first time. For the first few weeks, I stayed at various Airbnbs, before finding a flatshare I could join overlooking Arthur's seat. It was at work, rather than at university where I felt most impacted by Covid. My had to do my first weeks at work from home. I would log on to my laptop and wait for someone to message me. There was no way of knowing when/if that would happen, but I had to stay alert in case it did. It was not fun.<br>
<br>
Although the work at EY improved I remained bored. Tasks were repetitive and more importantly the topics were boring - primarily revolving around purchase-to-pay and order-to-cash processes of audit clients. By summer, 2022 I started looking for new opportunities. I thought perhaps I would be more interested in a job involving more writing and looked for journalist/reporter type roles. This is how I ended up as an energy markets reporter at ICIS.<br>
<br>
I had no previous experience in energy but I was interested in it. This was a few months after Russia had launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and gas prices were soaring. I wasn't sure exactly why did was happening or why it was important but it seemed interesting. That was good enough reason to accept the job at ICIS. What I didn't understand at the time was how exactly ICIS makes money.
